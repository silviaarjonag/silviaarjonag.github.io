## Overview
SyncdStudy is a collaborative web application designed to help university students find, join, and organize study sessions for their courses. The platform allows users to browse available sessions, filter by course or time, and receive notifications when new sessions are created. Built with Next.js, Supabase, and PostgreSQL, the app aims to promote peer learning and improve academic engagement through shared scheduling tools.

In addition to its core scheduling features, SyncdStudy includes user authentication, an admin dashboard for managing user activity, and a contact system that allows students to reach out with questions or concerns. Each user has access to a personalized calendar and session management tools, making it easy to keep track of their academic commitments. The interface is responsive and designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring usability across a wide range of devices. Overall, SyncdStudy helps foster a sense of academic community by making collaboration simple, efficient, and centralized.

## My Contributions

I worked as a full-stack developer and handled several core features of the application. My specific contributions included:
- Implementing the admin dashboard, which displays user activity, study session calendars, and submitted reports.
- Creating the 'Manage Users' interface for administrators, allowing them to view and manage registered students.
- Building the study session system, including the ability for users to create, edit, and delete their own sessions.
- Designing the Contact Us flow, where users can submit questions or issues that are forwarded to the admin panel.
- Setting up authentication and access control, including user role restrictions and protected page routing.
- Integrating Prisma with Supabase to sync authentication data into a custom User table via a serverless function.

## What I Learned
Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with all phases of software engineering, from initial planning to deployment. I learned how to integrate third-party tools like Supabase and Prisma to handle authentication, authorization, and relational data. I deepened my understanding of React and Next.js, especially in areas like dynamic routing, protected pages, and client-server communication. I also improved my ability to work in a collaborative team setting, using GitHub Projects and issue-driven development to coordinate tasks efficiently. Importantly, this project helped me recognize the value of designing systems with scalability and maintainability in mind, and how even small UX decisions can significantly affect user experience.
